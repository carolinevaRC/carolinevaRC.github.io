        <h1>About Rotary - What Is Rotary?</h1>
		
		<p>Rotary is an organization of business and professional leaders united worldwide who provide humanitarian service, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill and peace in the world. In more than 160 countries worldwide, approximately 1.2 million Rotarians belong to more than 30,000 Rotary clubs.</p>
 
        <p>Rotary club membership represents a cross-section of the community's business and professional men and women. The world's Rotary clubs meet weekly and are nonpolitical, nonreligious, and open to all cultures, races, and creeds.</p>
         
        <p>The main objective of Rotary is service — in the community, in the workplace, and throughout the world. Rotarians develop community service projects that address many of today's most critical issues, such as children at risk, poverty and hunger, the environment, illiteracy, and violence. They also support programs for youth, educational opportunities and international exchanges for students, teachers, and other professionals, and vocational and career development. The Rotary motto is <i>Service Above Self</i>.</p>

        <p>Although Rotary clubs develop autonomous service programs, all Rotarians worldwide are united in a campaign for the global eradication of polio. In the 1980s, Rotarians raised US$240 million to immunize the children of the world; by 2005, Rotary's centenary year and the target date for the certification of a polio-free world, the PolioPlus program will have contributed US$500 million to this cause. In addition, Rotary has provided an army of volunteers to promote and assist at national immunization days in polio-endemic countries around the world.</p>

        <h1>About Rotary - The Rotary Foundation</h1>
		<p>The Rotary Foundation of Rotary International is a not-for-profit corporation that promotes world understanding through international humanitarian service programs and educational and cultural exchanges. It is supported solely by voluntary contributions from Rotarians and others who share its vision of a better world. <b>Since 1947, the Foundation has awarded more than US$1.1 billion in humanitarian and educational grants</b>, which are initiated and administered by local Rotary clubs and districts.</p>
 
         <p>The Foundation was created in 1917 by Rotary International's sixth president, Arch C. Klumph, as an endowment fund for Rotary "to do good in the world." It has grown from an initial contribution of US$26.50 to more than US$73 million contributed in 2000-01. Its event-filled history is a story of Rotarians learning the value of service to humanity.</p>

One of the major Humanitarian Programs is PolioPlus, which seeks to eradicate the polio virus worldwide. Through its Educational Programs, the Foundation provides funding for some 1,200 students to study abroad each year. Grants are also awarded to university teachers to teach in developing countries and for exchanges of business and professional people. Former participants in the Foundation's programs have the opportunity to continue their affiliation with Rotary as Foundation Alumni.</p>

		<p>The 4-Way Test<br>
Of the things we think, say or do:</p>
 		</div>
		
		<br><br>
 		<ol>
			<li>Is it the TRUTH?</li>
			<li>Is it FAIR to all concerned?</li>
			<li>Will it build GOODWILL and BETTER FRIENDSHIPS?</li>
			<li>Will it be BENEFICIAL to all concerned?</li>
        </ol>
		
		<br><br>
		 
        <p>From the earliest days of the organization, Rotarians were concerned with promoting high ethical standards in their professional lives. One of the world's most widely printed and quoted statements of business ethics is The 4-Way Test, which was created in 1932 by Rotarian Herbert J. Taylor (who later served as RI president) when he was asked to take charge of a company that was facing bankruptcy. This 24-word code of ethics for employees to follow in their business and professional lives became the guide for sales, production, advertising, and all relations with dealers and customers, and the survival of the company is credited to this simple philosophy. Adopted by Rotary in 1943, The 4-Way Test has been translated into more than a hundred languages and published in thousands of ways.</p>

        <h1>Five Avenues of Service</h1>
		
		<p>The Object of Rotary is to “encourage and foster the ideal of service as a basis of worthy enterprise.”  Rotary is a service organization.  Since 1910, the Rotary Motto has been “<i>Service Above Self</i>.”</p>
 
        <p>Rotary strives to achieve it’s objective of “Service Above Self” through activities in five primary areas.  These are often referred to as the <i>Five Avenues of Service</i>.</p>
         
        <p><b><u>Club Service</u></b><br>
        This “Avenue” promotes the development of acquaintance as an opportunity for service.  It involves the activities necessary to make the Club function successfully and achieve its goals.</p>
         
        <p><b><u>Vocational Service</u></b><br>
        This area represents the opportunity that each Rotarian has to represent the dignity and utility of one’s vocation as an opportunity to serve society.  Rotarians promote and foster high ethical standards in business and professions and promote the recognition of the worthiness of all useful occupations.</p>
         
        <p><b><u>Community Service</u></b><br>
        This “Avenue” relates to the activities that Rotarians undertake to improve the quality of life in their community.  Particular emphasis is given to helping children, needy families, the aged, the handicapped, and those most in need of assistance.  Rotarians strive to promote the ideal of service in their personal, business, and community lives.</p>
         
        <p><b><u>International Service</u></b><br>
        In this area, Rotarians strive for the advancement of international understanding, goodwill, and peace through a world fellowship of business and professional persons united in the ideal of service.  International Service Projects are designed to meet the humanitarian needs of people in many lands, with particular emphasis on the most underprivileged children and families in developing countries.</p>
        
        <p><b><u>New Generations</u></b><br>
        By nurturing youth, Rotarians can provide the skills young people need to succeed as future community leaders. Youth Programs provide Rotarians the opportunity to develop their own leadership and communication skills and also provides for many incredible moments!</p>

        <h1>Becoming A Member - How To Join</h1>
		<p>Thank you for your interest in becoming a Rotarian.  Rotary International  is an association of individual clubs, with each club operating autonomously. Membership is extremely important to us, and we are always eager to hear from individuals interested in our mission and in joining a Rotary club. The RI universal premise is that the membership of each club constitutes an accurate representation of the business and professional population within the community served.</p>
 
        <p>Membership in a Rotary club requires available business or professional classification opportunities as well as an invitation and sponsorship by a member of the club. Sometimes an individual cannot be invited or sponsored for membership.</p>
         
        <p>Rotarians are business and professional leaders who take an active role in their communities while greatly enriching their personal and professional lives. A Rotary club contains a diverse group of professional leaders from the community that the club serves.</p>
         
        <p>Membership in a Rotary club offers a number of benefits, including:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li>effecting change within the community</li>
		<li>advancing business and professional contacts</li>
		<li>developing leadership skills</li>
		<li>gaining an understanding of — and having an impact on — international humanitarian issues</li>
		</ul>

        <p>Through Rotary International's service programs, a Rotary club can have a significant effect on the quality of life in its community. Rotary Foundation programs offer opportunities to form international partnerships that help people in need worldwide. Some 1.2  million Rotarians in 30,000 clubs in more than 160 countries make significant contributions to the quality of life at home and around the globe.</p>
